# Zoomcar Clone Phase Summary

## Phase 1 - Project Scaffolding & Docker Infrastructure

Created the Docker-based project scaffold for the Zoomcar clone.

Implemented:
- Root `docker-compose.yml` with MySQL 8, MongoDB 7, Redis 7, FastAPI backend, Celery worker, and Nginx on `zoomcar-net`.
- Backend scaffold under `backend/` with Dockerfile, requirements, entrypoint, FastAPI app, Alembic setup, Celery app, uploads folders, and a minimal seed script.
- Frontend scaffold under `frontend/` with Vite, React 18, Tailwind, required dependencies, Dockerfile, and starter UI.
- Nginx scaffold under `nginx/` that serves a placeholder frontend and proxies `/api/` to the backend.
- `.env.example` and working `.env` with MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, auth, email, upload, and simulated payment settings.

Verification:
- `docker compose config --quiet` passes.
- `docker compose up --build -d` builds and starts the stack.
- `http://localhost` serves the scaffold page.
- `http://localhost/api/health` returns a healthy backend response.

Notes:
- MySQL, MongoDB, and backend are exposed internally only to avoid local host port conflicts on `3306` and `8000`.
- Nginx remains the public entry point on `http://localhost`.

## Phase 2 - Dual Database Connection Layer

Set up the database connection layer for MySQL and MongoDB.

Implemented:
- `backend/app/database.py` with SQLAlchemy async engine, `AsyncSessionLocal`, `async_session_maker`, declarative `Base`, `get_db`, and `init_db`.
- `backend/app/mongodb.py` with Motor async client lifecycle, MongoDB connection verification, database accessor, disconnect handling, and startup index creation.
- `backend/app/config.py` with Pydantic settings for MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, auth, SMTP, app URLs, uploads, and simulated payments.
- `backend/app/main.py` with FastAPI lifespan startup that initializes MySQL and MongoDB, CORS, uploads mount, API metadata, health route, and router registration.
- Placeholder router modules under `backend/app/routers/` for auth, users, cars, bookings, payments, reviews, notifications, support, wishlist, host earnings, admin, and KYC.

Verification:
- `python3 -m compileall backend/app` passes.
- `docker compose config --quiet` passes.
- `docker compose up --build -d` starts successfully.
- Backend startup completes MySQL wait, MongoDB wait, Alembic migration check, seed check, and FastAPI startup.
- `http://localhost/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok","service":"zoomcar-backend"}`.
